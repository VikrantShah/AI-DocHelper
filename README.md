For many years, many people have died due to undetected diseases. Early detection
of these diseases at the micro classification stage can be useful for providing proper
treatment to the patients at the early stage and could have saved a lot of lives. A lot of
research is being done to detect these diseases at the earliest. Therefore, a computer-aided
or artificial intelligence approach for detecting diseases at the early stage is being proposed,
which makes use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for detecting diseases.
This system will detect all general diseases such as different types of cancer, malaria,
diabetic retinopathy, etc. AI-DocHelper is being proposed as there is no system available,
that detects all these general diseases.

AI-DocHelper system will be able to detect diseases at a very early stage. It will take
all the factors responsible or an image (to get the presence of virus, tumor, etc.) of a patient
for detecting the particular disease. It will also store all the results in the system for the
future use.
